    "question": "Endocrine function in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We sought to determine if failure to thrive in pediatric patients with the human immunodeficiency virus could be explained based on endocrine dysfunction. Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect.

    "question": "Expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Virus-specific T-cell responses are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury secondary to hepatitis B virus infection. In this study, liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were analyzed for expression of two major pathways of adhesion used by cytotoxic T cells to interact with target cells. The lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 was found preferentially expressed on hepatocytes of patients with active hepatitis B virus replication, whereas the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes seemed more closely related with inflammatory activity. Adhesion molecules were also highly expressed on T lymphocytes found in areas of piecemeal and spotty necrosis, indicating the presence of antigen-specific \"memory\" T cells at the site of hepatocellular injury. This study suggests that the expression of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 on hepatocytes may be important for viral elimination. The coordinate expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 may regulate inflammatory response and enhance viral antigen presentation to T cells. Conversely, the absence of hepatocyte adhesion molecules might be a favorable factor for viral persistence. ",

    "question": "Indications for use of ketoconazole in management of metastatic prostate cancer. Newer methods of androgen ablation for the treatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma have been developed as alternatives to the standard forms of therapy, oral estrogens and surgical castration. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the indications and to determine the role of ketoconazole in the management of metastatic prostatic cancer. Eighteen patients have been treated with ketoconazole. The indications for usage have included: prompt therapeutic response, when orchiectomy is contraindicated, when estrogens are contraindicated, initial empirical therapy, and hormonally refractory disease. It can also be used in conjunction with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Ketoconazole is excellent for short-term usage prior to bilateral orchiectomy and when prompt therapeutic response is needed but orchiectomy cannot be performed. However, it is not particularly useful for long-term hormonal therapy. ",

    "question": "Importance of the omentum in the development of intra-abdominal metastases. Areas of trauma are preferred sites for metastatic tumour growth. In extensive intra-abdominal tumour recurrence the omentum is invariably involved. The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated. Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy. Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour. With intraluminal injection, tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant). With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy. In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by, or be dependent on, the proximity of the omentum.

    "question": "Expression of beta 1 integrins in normal human keratinocytes. The majority of cell adhesive events to the extracellular matrix are mediated by cell surface receptors, beta 1 integrins. Keratinocytes express at least six different polypeptides of beta 1 integrin class, namely beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 (alpha 6 is mainly associated with beta 4 polypeptide). These epithelial cells use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen receptor and alpha 3 beta 1 as a fibronectin receptor, while alpha 6 beta 4 is the major basement membrane receptor. Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 complex is low. Processing of beta 1 integrins is fast in keratinocytes; half-maximal maturation takes only 3 hours. In addition to their function in cell-matrix interactions, beta 1 integrins (alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1) have also a role in maintaining keratinocyte cell-cell interactions. It is possible that resting basal keratinocytes use beta 1 integrins as cell-cell adhesion receptors, and during activation, like in wound healing, these receptors relocalize to mediate events involving cell-matrix interactions.

IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks. The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001. One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks. A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01. Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12).

Evidence for a common histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors from MIC2 expression and specific chromosome aberration. This study reports on the specific expression of the MIC2 gene, a pseudoautosomal gene located on the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes, on Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cells. The gene product, a cell membrane protein, is recognized by the newly established monoclonal antibody (MoAb) HBA-71 and the previously described MoAb 12E7 and RFB-1. Furthermore, the reaction pattern of the MIC2 antibodies, especially HBA-71, with normal tissues and a great number of benign and malignant tumors (70 different tumors, 199 tumor samples), as well as the correlation between the specific chromosomal aberrations, i.e., the t(11;22) and the del(22) and the expression of this antigen, are demonstrated. Both ES and pPNET cells express the MIC2 gene in very high amounts, which represents a highly selective and almost unique feature of these cells, making an assignment of these tumors in one entity even more likely. The MIC2 antibodies are of great value for clinical and research purposes. ",

    "question": "Acute lead poisoning in nursing home and psychiatric patients from the ingestion of lead-based ceramic glazes. To our knowledge, acute inorganic lead poisoning from single ingestions of lead compounds has been only rarely reported. During a 14-month period, we were contacted regarding eight instances of acute ingestions of liquid lead-based ceramic glazes by mentally impaired residents of nursing homes or psychiatric facilities participating in ceramic arts programs. While some ingestions did not cause toxic effects, some patients developed acute lead poisoning characterized by abdominal pain, anemia, and basophilic stippling of red blood cells. In the blood of several patients, lead concentrations were far above normal (4 to 9.5 mumol/L). Urinary lead excretions were tremendously elevated during chelation therapy, with one patient excreting 535.9 mumol/L of lead during a 6-day period, the largest lead excretion ever reported in a patient suffering from acute lead poisoning, to our knowledge. All patients recovered following supportive care and appropriate use of chelating agents. Lead-based glazes are commonly found in nursing homes and psychiatric facilities. We suspect that acute or chronic lead poisoning from the ingestion(s) of lead-based ceramic glazes may be an unrecognized but not uncommon problem among such residents. We urge physicians to take ingestions of lead-based glazes seriously and to consider the diagnosis of lead poisoning in nursing home and psychiatric patients who have participated in ceramic crafts programs.

    "question": "Vascular and microvascular changes--key factors in the development of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers in rats. The present study examined the time sequence and histologic and ultrastructural features of the formation and evolution of experimental, acetic acid-induced gastric ulcerations in rats. One hundred percent acetic acid was applied to the gastric serosa of 140 fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats through a polyethylene tube for 30 s. Gastric mucosal changes were evaluated at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, 1 and 3 h, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11 days after acetic acid application by visual inspection, by quantitative and qualitative light microscopy, and by transmission electron microscopy. Following exposure to acetic acid, the earliest morphologic changes occurred at 1 min and consisted of dilatation of large submucosal veins and arteries and mucosal collecting venules. Five to 15 minutes after injury, thrombi developed in submucosal veins and collecting venules, leading to microvascular stasis and mucosal necrosis. By 3 h, necrotic masses started to detach. By 24-48 h, necrotic changes penetrated the submucosa. By 72 h, most ulcers underwent transition into a \"chronic\" stage characterized histologically by the presence of granulation tissue at the bottom, and the appearance of a transitional healing zone at the margins. By 5 days, an increased amount of granulation tissue was observed and the gastric glands in transitional zones at the ulcer margin displayed cystic dilatation. Based on this study, we conclude that a key feature of acetic acid-induced ulcer formation is the early vascular and microvascular injury, which precedes glandular cell necrosis. ",

Confusion about definitions, study endpoints, and a lack of well-controlled clinical studies has led to this uncertainty. Codeine addiction is uncommon in people who do not have existing vulnerability to addiction, including alcoholism. Codeine use can sustain addiction or increase the risk of relapse in patients afflicted with addiction. The risk of relapse must be considered when treating conditions such as pain or cough in a person recovering from addiction.

    "question": "Development and characterization of a new, highly specific antibody to the human chorionic gonadotropin-beta fragment. In addition to high concentrations of hCG, pregnancy urine contains even higher concentrations of a fragment of the hCG beta-subunit. This biologically inactive material complicates immunological measurement of hCG, since it cross-reacts with many polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the hCG beta-subunit that are employed for assays of hCG in urine. Although we and others have developed antibodies to this fragment, specific measurement of the fragment in the presence of free hCG beta has remained difficult due to intrinsic cross-reactivity of these antibodies with the intact hCG beta. Rather than attempt to increase specificity by assay optimization, we developed a new, highly specific monoclonal antibody, designated B210, which cross-reacts less than 0.1% with the free hCG beta-subunit in both liquid and solid phase immunoassay formats. We have used this new monoclonal antibody in immunoradiometric assays to measure specifically the hCG beta fragment in urine throughout pregnancy as well as in the sera of two individuals with cancers producing the hCG beta-subunit. We discovered that the hCG beta fragment can bind three monoclonal antibodies simultaneously, indicating that although the epitope for antibody B210 is a new determinant exposed on the hCG beta fragment and not on intact hCG or on free hCG beta-subunit, the hCG beta fragment retains at least two other hCG beta-related epitopes intact, i.e. those that bind monoclonal antibodies B108 and B201.

    "question": "Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective analysis of 100 initial patients Laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly emerged as an alternative to open cholecystectomy. However its safety, efficacy, and morbidity have yet to be fully evaluated. During the first 6 months of 1990, we performed 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 8% (8 of 100 patients; 4 major, 4 minor). There were 81 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 46.1 years (range, 17 to 84 years). All patients had a preoperative history consistent with symptomatic biliary tract disease, and most had proved gallstones by sonography. This included four patients with acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time improved significantly from month 1 to month 6 (122 +/- 45.4 minutes versus 78.5 +/- 30 minutes, respectively), indicating a rapid learning curve. Mean hospital stay was 27.6 hours, reflecting a policy of overnight stay. Postoperative narcotic requirements were limited to oral or no medications in more than 70% of patients. A regular diet was tolerated by 83% of the patients by the morning following the procedure. Median time of return to full activity was 12.8 +/- 6.8 days after operation. In addition analysis of the hospital costs of these 100 cases demonstrates a modest cost advantage over standard open cholecystectomy (n = 58) (mean, $3620.25 +/- $1005.00 versus $4251.76 +/- $988.00). There was one minor bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion, two postoperative bile collections, and one clinical diagnosis of a retained stone that passed spontaneously. Four patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of technical difficulties with the dissection. Although there is a significant learning curve, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by surgeons who are trained in biliary surgery and knowledgeable in biliary anatomy, and, as with all operations, it should be performed with meticulous attention to technique.

One hundred twelve patients with non-small cell lung cancer adjacent to the pleural surface who underwent computed tomographic scanning and subsequent thoracotomy were entered into this study. Tumor invasion was confined to the visceral pleura in 53 patients, to the parietal pleura in 18 patients, and to intercostal muscles in 25 patients; invasion extended beyond this layer in 16 patients. The computed tomographic criteria for chest wall invasion were (1) obliteration of the extrapleural fat plane, (2) the length of the tumor-pleura contact, (3) the ratio between the tumor-pleura contact and the tumor diameter, (4) the angle of the tumor with the pleura, (5) a mass involving the chest wall, and (6) rib destruction. The computed tomographic criteria 1 and 3 were significantly related to pathologic findings. Sensitivity was 85% for criterion 1 and 83% for criterion 3, specificity being 87% and 80%, respectively. Long-term survival of patients with T3 disease critically depended on the lymph node state and completeness of resection. The adenocarcinoma cell type and the T4 category were unfavorable prognostic factors. The depth of chest wall invasion did not affect survival, except for extensive rib and soft tissue infiltration.

SUBJECTS--During 1984-6, 74,977 persons (88.1% of those aged 20 years and over) participated in the health survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Hypertension (when assessed by standardised recording and by questionnaires on drug treatment for hypertension) according to the blood pressure thresholds used in the Norwegian treatment programme. Subjects positive on screening were grouped after clinical examination into treatment groups. RESULTS--In all, 2399 subjects were positive for hypertension. Before screening 6210 (8.3%) patients reported taking antihypertensive drugs and another 3849 (5.1%) had their blood pressure monitored regularly. All who screened positive were referred to their general practitioner and evaluated according to a standard programme. As a result, drug treatment was started in 406 (0.5%) participants screened and blood pressure monitoring in another 1007 (1.3%). Of all patients taking antihypertensive drugs after the screening, 6399 (94.0%) had been diagnosed before screening, and of those whose blood pressure was monitored after the screening, 79.3% had been diagnosed before screening.

    "question": "The role of cholecystokinin in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the isolated pancreas preparation. In a variety of animal models of acute pancreatitis, cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have ameliorated the injury response. These results suggest that cholecystokinin may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis initiated by multiple stimuli. In an effort to test this theory, a sensitive and high affinity cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L364,718 was administered to four different models of acute pancreatitis that were produced in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas preparation. The four models of pancreatitis were initiated by cerulein infusion, partial duct obstruction with secretin stimulation, oleic acid infusion, and a 2-hour period of ischemia. In each model, pancreatitis was manifest by edema formation, weight gain, and hyperamylasemia during a 4-hour perfusion. In cerulein infusion-induced pancreatitis L364,718 inhibited edema formation and weight gain (31 +/- 5 gm versus 7 +/- 6 gm; p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased plasma amylase activity (36,605 +/- 21,216 U/dl versus 9421 +/- 5149 U/dl; p less than 0.05). The acute pancreatitis induced by the other three stimuli was not ameliorated by L364,718 treatment. We conclude that in the ex vivo-perfused canine pancreas preparation cerulein-induced pancreatitis is mediated at least in part by the cholecystokinin receptor. Early blockade of the cholecystokinin receptor was of no benefit in treating the other models of pancreatitis, suggesting that cholecystokinin is not involved in the early pathogenesis. ",

Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints.

Seventy-three consecutive cases were collected from two regional certified poison control centers from January 1989 to August 1989. There were 25 exposures in children less than 6 yrs., 11 exposures in adolescents, and 37 exposures in adults. Ten adult cases and one adolescent case were excluded from the study due to the presence of coingestants or inadequate information. Peak measured serum levels ranged from 0.3 to 56 mcg/ml.

Increased serum levels of carbamazepine did appear to correlate with increased hospital stay, but not with ICU stay. History of a seizure disorder appears to pose increased risk of a seizure in carbamazepine overdose. In this series chronic exposure to carbamazepine did not appear to increase the risk of coma or respiratory depression for a given toxic serum level and may add some protective effect. Serum levels below 40 mcg/ml do not appear to accurately predict the severity of toxicity. Cardiac conduction defects were rare (one child). Anticholinergic findings, as evidence by decreased bowel motility and sinus tachycardia were common. Previous cardiovascular disease and age did not appear to be important prognostic indicators. ",

    "question": "Availability of transplantable organs from brain stem dead donors in intensive care units. OBJECTIVE--By audit from January to June 1989 to quantify, separately for hearts, kidneys, liver, lungs and corneas, the possible increases in transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units and to compare them with the increases achieved in October-November 1989, during intense, national publicity about transplantation. DESIGN--Prospective audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England from 1 January to 30 June 1989 and subsequent case study of the impact of publicity on offers and donations during October-November 1989. SETTING--15 regional and special health authorities in England. PATIENTS--5803 patients dying in intensive care units, of whom 497 were confirmed as brain stem dead and had no general medical contraindication to organ donation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Organ specific suitability for transplantation (as reported by intensive care units); consent for donation of specific suitable organs; and procurement of specific organs reported as suitable for transplantation and offered. RESULTS--In the 497 (8.6%) brain stem dead potential donors were estimated the organ specific suitability for heart as 63%, kidneys 95%, liver 70%, lungs 29%, and corneas 91%. Refusal of relatives (30%) accounted for major losses of suitable organs of all types. For kidneys the loss was equivalent to 44% of brain stem dead actual kidney donors. No discussion of organ donation was the second most important reason for missed kidney donors, the loss being equivalent to 10% of brain stem dead actual donors. Non-procurement or difficulties with allocating organs was the second most notable cause of missed suitable liver and lung donors; 29% (55) of the offered total of 189 liver donors and 27% (21) of 78 offered suitable lung donors in six months. Non-procurement of suitable, offered organs was rare for kidneys and modest, of the order of 13% and 10% respectively, for heart and corneas. Corneal donation from brain stem dead potential donors might be improved nearly as much (that is, a 78% increase in brain stem dead actual corneal donors) by specific measures to promote corneal donation when other organs are offered as by reducing the overall refusal rate. Restricted offers, non-procurement, and no discussion of donation accounted for nearly equal numbers of lost donations of hearts (each equivalent to 15% of donated hearts). During October-November 1989 when there was intense, positive publicity about transplantation the rates of refusal and non-discussion fell compared with during January-June (22%, 36/163 v 30%, 138/460; 7%, 33/497 v 2%, 4/167 respectively). Offers of suitable donors increased significantly (p less than 0.02) compared with the first six months of 1989, most notably for heart donors (80 v 60.1 expected) and kidney donors (122 v 102.1 expected) but only for kidneys was there a noticeable 17% increase in actual donors (118 actual audited donors v 100.8 expected donors; p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS--Four strategies to increase the supply of transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units were identified: (a) reducing refusal of relatives (b) avoiding non-procurement of actually suitable organs (by logistical initiatives) and deterioration of initially suitable organs (by donor care initiatives); (c) converting restricted offers to unrestricted offers; and (d) ensuring discussion with families. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator gives time for discussion about donor care and agreement on medical suitability for donation of specific organs. Solving some of the logistical problems of non-procurement may be a prerequisite for increased offers to be translated into increased donations. The impact of publicity therefore needs to be measured on offers of suitable donors as well as by actual donations. ",

    "question": "Circulating C1q-binding macromolecules and their relationship to radiographic characteristics of laryngeal cancer. Circulating macromolecules capable of binding the first component of complement (C1qBM) may represent subcellular components of tissue/tumor debris generated from rapidly proliferating invasive disease. Thirty-eight patients were randomly selected from 74 untreated patients with laryngeal cancer on the basis of disease stage and C1qBM levels. C1qBM levels were correlated with computed tomographic evidence of tumor necrosis and/or thyroid cartilage destruction. Results show that patients with stage III/IV disease with tissue necrosis and/or cartilage invasion had demonstrably higher C1qBM levels than did individuals with similarly staged disease with no evidence of these radiographically defined characteristics (120 +/- 81 micrograms/mL vs 18 +/- 15 micrograms/mL); the strongest association was reflected by the area of necrosis within regional lymph metastases. Elevated C1qBM level in patients with stage III/IV laryngeal cancer thus reflects highly aggressive disease, which is less responsive to therapeutic intervention. ",

To study the early course of schizophrenia, we assessed 79 early phase, young, DSM-III schizophrenic patients at two successive posthospital follow-ups, 2.5 and 5.0 years after index hospitalization. More than 50% of the sample had poor overall outcome, with either severe impairment in functioning and symptoms, or suicide, in the follow-up period. Rehospitalization rates decreased significantly during the course of the two posthospital assessments, despite the sample showing persisting psychosis. Only a small group of schizophrenic patients showed complete remission: 10% at the first follow-up and 17% at the second follow-up, when patients who suicided are excluded from consideration. While progressive deterioration is not common in schizophrenia, our relatively negative findings challenge the conclusions of some other longitudinal studies. Implications of our data on schizophrenic course are discussed. ",

    "question": "A chronic granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. A small clinically distinct group of patients with widespread tissue granulomata are described. The principal presenting symptoms are malaise, fever, and weight loss, although a wide variety of complaints are documented. Pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The granulomata are noncaseating with a few multinucleate giant cells and some surrounding chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of an associated arteritis. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course and although it may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly if the kidneys are involved, the prognosis is relatively good. We propose that this entity be called granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. The characteristics that set this syndrome apart from the other granulomatous vasculitides are discussed. The current limited understanding of granuloma formation does not allow us to propose a definite etiology for this condition. It is emphasized that it is not helpful to encompass it within a label of sarcoidosis. First, it may only serve to confuse the doctor in assessing and treating this very particular group of patients. Secondly, it may hinder future attempts to understand the different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the various conditions in which granulomata may arise. ",

    "question": "Persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism: assessment with gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging. The effect of gadopentetate dimeglumine on signal intensity of abnormal parathyroid glands was assessed in 14 patients with persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Non-contrast material-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images were compared with T1-weighted images obtained 1 minute and 10 minutes after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Percentage of contrast between the abnormal gland and surrounding tissue was determined with the use of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, and thyroid gland as reference tissues. All 11 abnormal parathyroid glands showed low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Gadopentetate dimeglumine significantly increased the signal intensity enhancement ratio of all abnormal parathyroid glands, causing increased percentage of contrast relative to the thyroid gland and skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images. However, the percentage of contrast relative to these tissues was even greater on nonenhanced T2-weighted images. Thus, gadopentetate dimeglumine can substantially enhance the signal intensity of abnormal parathyroid glands and improve differential contrast with some neighboring tissues on T1-weighted images, but it does not improve contrast with surrounding tissue beyond that achieved on T2-weighted images.

    "question": "Intraatrial extension of thyroid cancer: technique and results of a radical surgical approach. An occlusion of the superior vena cava by a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium was diagnosed in three patients with a follicular thyroid cancer. All patients showed the typical clinical picture of the superior vena cava syndrome. A right parasternal thoracotomy was performed for preparation of the major vessels. The superior vena cava was opened and the entire intravascular tumor thrombus was removed. The cavotomy was closed directly in two patients. In the third patient the left brachiocephalic trunk was resected and reconstructed with a vascular (polytetrafluoroethylene) graft. This patient had bone and brain metastases and an occlusion of the graft 3 months after surgery after anticoagulation was stopped. The other two patients were clinically symptom free without local recurrence 13 and 50 months after surgery. An aggressive surgical approach is justified in grossly invasive thyroid cancer to decrease local recurrence and death rates, to correct the disturbing clinical symptoms of superior vena caval occlusion, and to prevent tumor embolism and the development of distant metastases. By reducing tumor mass, an even better basis for radioiodine treatment can be prepared. ",

    "question": "Spontaneous and steroid-induced recurrence of endometriosis after suppression by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist in the rat. Recurrent endometriosis in women is difficult to study because of the ethical consideration of performing repeated surgeries. Previously in the rat model we described therapeutic regression of endometriosis with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist antide. Presently we report the spontaneous and steroid-induced recurrence of endometriosis after withdrawal from antide therapy. Rats with endometriosis received antide or vehicle on days 0 (proestrus), 3, 6, and 9 and were killed on days 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 42 (n = 4 antide-treated and 4 vehicle-treated rats killed per day). Additional antide-treated rats (n = 4 per treatment) received estrogen, progesterone, both estrogen and progesterone, cholesterol, and no steroid on day 9 and were killed on day 12. Antide significantly suppressed endometriotic implant size on days 12, 18, and 24. However, implant size spontaneously returned to pretreatment values by day 30. Administration of steroids on day 9 elicited regrowth of antide-suppressed endometriosis (estrogen plus progesterone greater than estrogen, progesterone, or cholesterol greater than no steroid) by day 12. This resilience of endometriosis offers an explanation for treatment failure and recurrence of the disease in women. ",

After multiple hospital admissions and an inpatient rehabilitation stay, a 68-year-old woman was transferred to our rehabilitation facility with a paraparesis of unknown etiology.

The correct diagnosis, confirmed by selective angiography, was ultimately contingent upon recognition of the clinical features and natural history of dural spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (SCAVM). The unusual combination of this multitude of nondiagnostic imaging studies in the uncommon dural SCAVM served to delay diagnosis and treatment. Such delay may have great functional consequences. This report illustrates the importance of suspecting SCAVM and recognizing its features.

To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance.

    "question": "Adrenal medullary implants in the rat spinal cord reduce nociception in a chronic pain model. Previous work in this laboratory has indicated that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the subarachnoid space of the rat spinal cord can reduce pain sensitivity to acute noxious stimuli, particularly following stimulation by nicotine. This most likely results from the stimulated release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells. However, chronic pain models may more closely resemble human clinical pain, and the arthritic rat model has been used for screening potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for adrenal medullary tissue implanted into the spinal subarachnoid space to alleviate chronic pain. Adrenal medullary tissue was implanted into adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, and changes in body weight and vocalization responses were monitored over the 10 week course of the disease. Results indicate that the severe weight reduction normally associated with this inflammatory arthritis was attenuated by adrenal medullary, but not control, implants. In addition, vocalizations were reduced in animals implanted with adrenal medullary, but not control tissue following nicotine stimulation. This reduction was blocked by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, and partially attenuated by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine. Together, these results suggest that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord may provide a local source of opioid peptides and catecholamines for the reduction of chronic pain.

Patients were classified by electrophysiological study results as having no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were examined for the duration of low-amplitude (less than or equal to 40 microV) QRS signal, duration of total QRS, and root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS. Low-amplitude terminal root-mean-square voltage of 100 microV or less had 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity for ventricular tachycardia inducible by electrophysiological study. Similar sensitivity but less specificity were seen using the criterion of 20 msec or more total low-amplitude QRS signal (initial plus terminal) or using total QRS duration of 128 msec or more.
