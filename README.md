# What is FloTorch?

FloTorch is an innovative product poised to transform the field of Generative AI by simplifying and optimizing the decision-making process for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital landscape, selecting the right LLM setup is critical for achieving efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. However, this process often involves extensive trial-and-error, significant resource expenditure, and complex comparisons of performance metrics. Our solution addresses these challenges with a streamlined, user-friendly approach.

**Latest Update**: FloTorch now supports Bedrock knowledge bases and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model on Sagemaker.

## Key Features

- **Automated Evaluation of LLMs**: FloTorch evaluates multiple LLMs by analyzing combinations of hyperparameters defined by the end user.
- **Performance Metrics**: Produces detailed performance scores, including relevance, fluency, and robustness.
- **Cost and Time Insights**: Provides actionable insights into the pricing and execution times for each LLM configuration.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Empowers users to align LLM configurations with specific goals and budget constraints.

# Open Source Developer Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project to maintain consistency and code quality.

### Master Branch

- The `master` branch is the primary branch and should remain stable.
- **Avoid pushing directly to the `master` branch.** All changes must go through the pull request process.

### Feature Branches

- All new feature branches must be created from the `master` branch.
- Use descriptive names for feature branches.  
  Example: `feature/bedrock_claude_inferencer`

### Pull Requests

- All code changes must be submitted as pull requests.
- Each pull request should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Keep pull requests small and focused on a specific feature or fix.
- Include relevant information in commit messages to provide context.

### Branch Hygiene

- Delete feature branches after they have been successfully merged into `master`.

### Testing Changes Locally

- Before submitting a pull request, thoroughly test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.

### Naming Conventions

- Use **snake_case** for:
  - names
  - Configuration variables
  - python file names
    Example: `example_snake_case`
