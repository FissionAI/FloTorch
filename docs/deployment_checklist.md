## Deployment Process

### Development Environment Deployment

- [ ] Pull latest code changes from main repository branch
- [ ] Execute `./provision.sh` with development environment parameters
- [ ] Verify all CloudFormation stacks created successfully
- [ ] Run smoke tests to verify basic functionality
- [ ] Document any issues in deployment issue tracker

### Staging Environment Deployment

- [ ] Create CloudFormation change sets to preview resource modifications
- [ ] Execute staging deployment with production-equivalent configuration
- [ ] Run full integration test suite against staging environment
- [ ] Verify all monitoring and alerting functions correctly
- [ ] Document performance metrics and compare to baselines
- [ ] Obtain approval from QA team after successful verification

### Production Deployment

- [ ] Schedule deployment during approved maintenance window
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of upcoming deployment
- [ ] Back up existing configuration and state if applicable
- [ ] Execute CloudFormation deployment with approved parameters
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress in real-time via CloudWatch
- [ ] Run post-deployment verification tests
- [ ] Verify all CloudWatch alarms are in healthy state
- [ ] Update deployment documentation with execution details

## Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback Triggers

- [ ] Configure CloudWatch alarms to monitor critical service metrics
- [ ] Set threshold-based alerts for immediate notification
- [ ] Establish automated rollback procedure for critical failures
- [ ] Test rollback procedure in staging environment

### Manual Rollback Procedure

1. **Evaluate Issue Impact**
   - Determine if rollback is necessary based on severity matrix
   - Document issue details for post-deployment review

2. **Execute Rollback**
   - Run `aws cloudformation rollback-stack` to previous stable state
   - Alternatively, execute deployment with previous version parameters

3. **Verify Rollback Success**
   - Run validation tests against rolled-back environment
   - Confirm system operations have been restored
   - Update stakeholders on status

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Service Health Checks

- [ ] Verify OpenSearch cluster status is green
- [ ] Confirm ECS services are running with correct task counts
- [ ] Validate AppRunner service is available and responding
- [ ] Check DynamoDB tables are active and queryable
- [ ] Verify S3 buckets are accessible with correct permissions

### Functional Verification

- [ ] Complete end-to-end test of document ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Verify embedding generation succeeds for test documents
- [ ] Complete retrieval tests with predefined test queries
- [ ] Validate UI displays correct results and metrics
- [ ] Execute sample experiment workflows end-to-end

### Performance Validation

- [ ] Document post-deployment performance metrics
- [ ] Compare metrics to pre-deployment baseline
- [ ] Verify resource utilization is within expected ranges
- [ ] Run load tests to ensure scalability meets requirements

|------|------|----------------|------|
| DevOps Engineer | | □ Approved □ Rejected | |
| QA Lead | | □ Approved □ Rejected | |
| Product Owner | | □ Approved □ Rejected | |
| Security Reviewer | | □ Approved □ Rejected | |
